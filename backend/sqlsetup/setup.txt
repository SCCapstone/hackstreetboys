Create a new database called "fridger" in MySQL

Then select it, and run the populate script. 
This will create the tables that we have talked about using so far and will populate them with just a few tuples a piece
with super basic dummy data.

As we go forward we can play around with the data types and handling different types and this database 
will DEFINITELY need to be improved because it sucks right now. It's just SOMETHING to get started.
